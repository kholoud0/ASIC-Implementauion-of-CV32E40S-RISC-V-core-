# ASIC-Implementauion-of-CV32E40S-RISC-V-core-
This repository contains graduation projectof my BSc degree at the Faculty of Engineering ASU. The project focuses on implementing the RISC-V core, specifically the CV32E40 ,with a focus on achieving high performance and maximizing frequency through synthesis, place and route (PNR).
# Integration with PULPino SoC
In addition to the ASIC implementation of the RISC-V core, this project involves the integration of the designed core into the PULPino System-on-Chip (SoC). This step ensures that the high-performance RISC-V core is effectively utilized within a larger system context, enhancing its versatility and applicability.
